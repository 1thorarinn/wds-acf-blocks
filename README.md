WDS ACF Blocks
===
With the advent of Gutenberg in WordPress, Advanced Custom Fields stepped up to help make the process of creating custom blocks easier and faster. This plugin creates a set of custom blocks with basic styles for you to customize in your theme.

This plugin includes the following blocks:
- Accordion
- Call To Action
- Carousel
- Fifty/Fifty
- Hero
- Recent Posts
- Related Posts

WDS ACF Blocks is bundled with a [Style Lint](https://stylelint.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) linting rulesets â€“ plus, it passes both WCAG 2.1AA and Section 508 standards out of the box.

To better manage ACF Field Groups, the plugin supports [synchronized JSON](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/synchronized-json/) for Advanced Custom Fields.
